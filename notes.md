//File System Routing :

    The file-system-based router in Next.js is based on the concept of pages. When you add a file to the pages directory, it becomes available as a route right away. That is, the file system is used by Next.js to facilitate routing in the app. Every file in the pages directory is automatically treated as a route by Next. In Next.js, a page is a React component with a route based on the file name.

    For new applications, App Router is used . This router allows you to use React's latest features and is an evolution of the Pages Router .
